# ip-ranges.json

----
## To-do:
* Trim out the *-by-* scripts using util-arg-is-*.sh scripts.
  * This has been started with v2-*.sh scripts!
* ~~Develop some snazzy logic to detect valid aws-service and aws-region names provided as arguments~~.
* ~~Look for existence of curl and jq command line tools.~~
* ~~Download ip-ranges.json once per 24 hours, cache locally.~~
* ~~Create list-aws-prefixes-v6-by-service.sh~~
